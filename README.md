# IP Finder

IP Finder is a service that servers a simple REST API for finding your public IP in a running Kubernetes or Docker Swarm cluster. In cases that you have a dynamic public IP address and you are using something like Cloudflare tunnel this service can be useful for finding your cluster's IP with the fully qualified domain name (FQDM) of your tunnel.
